### Project overview 

This data analysis project aims to provide insight into the sales performance of a company over few months. By analysing various aspects of the sales data,we seek to identify trends, best selling products and gain deeper understanding of the company's performance.

### Data sources 

Sales data: The primary dataset used for this analysis is the "executive data. csv" file

### Tools

- Excel


### Data cleaning
  In the initial data cleaning phase, we performed the following tasks
  
 1.  Removing duplicates

 2.  Handling data that may distort analysis
   
 3.  Transforming data into a more standardized form

 4.   Ensuring that each cells contains appropriate data types

 5. Removing irrelevant features

### Exploratory Data Analysis 

EDA involved exploring the sales data to answer key questions, such as:
- The sales trend report
- The top 10 selling products 
- The sales by rep
- The sales by region
- The sales by channel
- The least selling products
- The order by store type

 ### Result/findings

   The analysis result are summarized as follows:
 
i. Sales peaks in January and May suggest seasonal demand, likely tied to holidays or promotions.

  ii. High-quality products offer strong perceived value to customers and also meet clear customer needs or trends.

iii. They have built a loyal customer base through great customer service, repeat purchases, or word-of-mouth referrals.

iv. Diverse region with strong, untapped potential and balanced sales with growth opportunities.

v. Sales are evenly spread across channels, reducing dependency on one method.

vi. Lack of visibility or promotion leads to low awareness and sales.

vii. The company relies heavily on its city location for revenue, creating both opportunities and risks.


### Recommendations

Based on the analysis, we recommend the following:

- Create marketing strategies around seasonal events or holidays to maintain momentum and also use product bundles or cross-promotions to encourage off-peak purchases.

- Ensure top-performing products are always stocked to avoid missed sales opportunities and expand or diversify the product line to capture related market segments and boost overall sales.

- Continue to build on existing strengths, focus on customer retention, and explore new market opportunities. Focus on refining the product-market fit, improving marketing strategies, and addressing any pricing or operational inefficiencies

- Increase brand awareness and explore partnerships to capitalize on growth potential.

- Evaluate the profitability of each channel to ensure cost-effectiveness.

- Boost visibility through targeted campaigns to highlight the product's unique value.

- Invest in online platforms to complement city operations and reach a broader customer base. Ensure brand and service consistency across all locations to build a cohesive customer experience.


### Limitations

I had to remove all values after the decimal point from revenue column to ensure accuracy in my analysis.
